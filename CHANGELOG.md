# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Fatbody D&D Framework** will be documented in this file.

## [2026-04-22] - UI & Prompt Hardening

### Added
- **Resource Depletion Logic**: The DM now strictly monitors resource usage. If a player attempts to use an ability or spell with 0 uses remaining, the DM will pause the narrative and request a different action.
- **Combat Field Expansion**: Enemies now track "Other" properties (Resistances, Immunities, Special Traits) with dedicated styling in the HUD.

### Changed
- **Interactive Unit Pills**: Standardized the **Traits** and **Abilities** sections into interactive "Unit Pills."
- **Tooltip System 2.0**: Descriptions are now revealed in a glassmorphism hover bubble that does not cause layout shifts (fixing the edge-of-screen "flashing" bug).
- **CSS Iconography**: Replaced distorted unicode characters with perfectly circular, CSS-drawn info icons (ⓘ).
- **Smart Parsing**: Implemented a stack-based parser to correctly handle complex traits and abilities that contain internal commas.
- **Global Deselect**: Clicking any empty space on the tracker now automatically closes any open interactive elements.

## [2026-04-21] - Rebranding & Physics Integration
- **Framework Rebranding**: Renamed from RPG Tracker to **Fatbody D&D Framework**.
- **RNG Physics Engine**: Integrated the Prompt Injection RNG system for transparent, physics-based rolling.
- **HUD Controls**: Added "SYSPROMPT" and "RNG" toggle buttons directly to the tracker panel.
- **Optimized Layout**: Reordered sections to prioritize Character and Combat status over meta-stats like XP and Time.
- **Factory Reset**: Added a "Factory Reset" button to the settings panel for easy recovery of default prompts.
